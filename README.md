# Football
It's just an old turn-based football project that I had to create in my first programming training year.

### "A.I"

The "artificial intelligence" is nothing too special. The program is just analyzing the current situation of the game:

Game Situation:
- Normal
- FreeKick
- ThrowIn
- CornerKick
- GoalKick
- KickOff

Player/Team/Ball Position:

- Does the player control the ball?
- Is he surrounded by enemies? --> Run to a free spot!
- Where is the ball (in the own half or not etc.)?
- Is the own team or the enemy controling the ball?
- Where are the teammates?
- ...

### Other Features

The game also has a replay manager for save games,
"fully" customizable settings (goal position, kickoff position, goal size, seconds per turn) and a multiplayer (I have to commit the latter, though)..
